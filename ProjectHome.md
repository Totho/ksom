KSOM is a portable implementation of the Kohonen Self-Organizing Map model written in C using the NetBeans 2.6.1 IDE. Also included is a Python module prototype of the library.

The library itself compiles on both 64 bit Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux without an issue. The example program "ksom\_example" is not intended to be cross platform, though should compile on Linux with a few minor changes to the NetBeans project settings. The source code should not need modified.

Linux and Windows binaries may be available in the near  future.
